This project detects the freshness of apples. 

To run this code first you need to set up an environment. The steps you need to follow is 
Installing Anaconda, CUDA, and cuDNN,
Setting up the Object Detection directory structure and Anaconda Virtual Environment,
Gathering and labeling pictures,
Generating training data,
Creating a label map and configuring training,
Training,
Exporting the inference graph,
Testing and using your newly trained object detection classifier

Here we have used tensorflow 1.5 and python 3.6 and faster RCNN inception CoCo model for modeling. To run code you first need to set up environment and then run code  Object_detection_webcam.py.This code is able to identify freshness of any kind of apple with respect to size, color and shape.
